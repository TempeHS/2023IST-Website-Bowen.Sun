      <h2>Effects on Students</h2>
      <p>AI can have negative effects on students. It can lead to job displacement, as certain tasks that were previously performed by humans are automated by AI. This can create a challenging job market for students entering the workforce. Additionally, excessive reliance on AI for tasks such as problem-solving and decision-making can hinder the development of critical thinking and creativity in students.</p>

      <h2>Effects on Parents</h2>

This can lead to financial instability and stress for parents. Additionally, concerns regarding privacy and data security arise with the increasing use of AI systems, which can affect parents' trust in these technologies.</p>
