      <h2>Effects on Students</h2>
      <p>AI can have negative effects on students. It can lead to job displacement, as certain tasks that were previously performed by humans are automated by AI. This can create a challenging job market for students entering the workforce. Additionally, excessive reliance on AI for tasks such as problem-solving and decision-making can hinder the development of critical thinking and creativity in students.</p>
